### Goal:
The goal of my project is to develop a comprehensive 50/30/20 Budget Template in Google Sheets that simplifies personal finance management. This template will help users allocate their income into three key categories: 50% for needs, 30% for wants, and 20% for savings and debt repayment. By providing a clear structure for budgeting, users can easily track their expenses, assess their financial health, and make informed decisions about their spending. The template will also include visual charts and summaries to enhance understanding and encourage better financial habits, ultimately empowering users to achieve their financial goals.
